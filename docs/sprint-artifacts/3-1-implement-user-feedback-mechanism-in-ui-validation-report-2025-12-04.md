- **Task-AC Mapping:** Tasks and subtasks are clearly mapped to acceptance criteria, and sufficient testing tasks are included, exceeding the minimum AC count.
- **Dev Notes Quality:** The Dev Notes provide specific architectural guidance, component references, and a clear summary of testing standards.
- **Story Structure:** The story adheres to the specified "As a / I want / so that" format, and metadata like status, epic/story numbers, and title are correctly set.
