# Epic 2 Retrospective: Core Question Answering - 2025-12-04

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the retrospective for Epic 2, "Core Question Answering". The epic aimed to enable students to get instant, accurate answers to their most common course-related questions through an AI-powered chatbot. The team successfully completed all 4 stories, achieving 100% completion of the functional requirements for core Q&A.

Key insights highlighted the success of the RAG pipeline implementation and streaming responses, but also underscored the persistent challenge of unaddressed technical debt, particularly around automated UI/UX/Accessibility testing carried over from Epic 1. A critical decision was made to dedicate a prep sprint to addressing these foundational quality issues and process improvements before commencing Epic 3, necessitating an Epic 3 planning review session.

## Epic 2 Summary

## Successes and Strengths

-   **Core RAG Functionality:** Successful implementation of natural language query understanding, knowledge base retrieval, and conversational response generation, proving the core concept of the RAG pipeline.
-   **Responsive Streaming:** The use of streaming responses for conversational outputs resulted in a snappy and fluid user experience, significantly improving perceived performance.
-   **Robust Backend Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests for the backend components (query parser, retriever, generator) ensured high quality and caught potential issues early.
-   **AI Safety:** Explicit handling of "I don't know" scenarios, preventing LLM hallucination and enhancing user trust.

## Challenges and Growth Areas

-   **Persistent Technical Debt (NFR Testing):** The most significant challenge was the carry-over from Epic 1 of unaddressed automated UI/UX/Accessibility testing for the frontend. This gap consistently surfaced in story reviews, highlighting a systemic testing weakness.
-   **Pydantic Deprecation Warnings:** Recurring Pydantic deprecation warnings indicated a low-severity, but persistent, technical debt item.
-   **Balancing Act:** A continuous challenge was balancing the prioritization of core functional delivery against addressing crucial non-functional requirements and technical debt, leading to deferrals that accumulated.

## Key Insights and Learnings

1.  **Importance of NFR Follow-Through:** Action items from previous retrospectives, especially concerning foundational non-functional requirements and technical debt, require diligent follow-through to prevent them from becoming recurring issues.
2.  **Value of Automated UI/UX/Accessibility Testing:** The lack of automated testing for UI aspects creates a blind spot in quality assurance and increases risk for new UI development. Robust automated NFR testing is critical for comprehensive quality.
3.  **Proactive Technical Debt Management:** Regularly addressing technical debt, even seemingly minor items like deprecation warnings, is essential for long-term compatibility and maintainability.
4.  **Deployment Process Clarity:** A clear discrepancy between planned and actual deployment status for Epics 1 and 2 highlighted a need for more precise and aligned deployment tracking.

## Previous Retro Follow-Through Analysis

-   **Action Items from Epic 1 Retrospective (6 total):**
    -   Improve early communication and requirements finalization for backend stories. (Status: ❌ Not Addressed - surfaced again as a challenge)
    -   Establish a clear process for handling schema changes. (Status: ❌ Not Addressed - surfaced again as a challenge)
    -   Implement robust automated UI tests for responsiveness and accessibility. (Status: ❌ Not Addressed - surfaced as major challenge in Epic 2)
    -   Fully implement knowledge base file permissions (AC7 from Story 1.2). (Status: ❌ Not Addressed - not explicitly mentioned but context implies still pending)
    -   Address Pydantic deprecation warnings. (Status: ❌ Not Addressed - surfaced again as a challenge)
    -   RAG architecture and prompt engineering knowledge transfer/spike. (Status: ✅ Completed - knowledge demonstrated by successful RAG implementation in Epic 2)

-   **Lessons Applied:** The RAG architecture knowledge transfer seemed successful, as the team effectively implemented the core RAG components.
-   **Missed Opportunities:** The team repeated previous mistakes by not addressing the UI testing gaps and Pydantic warnings, leading to them becoming significant discussion points in Epic 2's retrospective.

## Next Epic Preview and Dependencies

-   **Next Epic:** Epic 3: User Feedback Loop
-   **Dependencies:** Epic 3 is highly dependent on the core Q&A functionality and responsive UI established in Epic 2 (specifically Story 2.3). New UI components for feedback will build on the existing chat interface.

## Significant Discoveries and Epic Update Recommendations

-   **Significant Changes Identified:**
    1.  **Persistent Lack of Automated UI/UX/Accessibility Testing:** Impact: The assumption that Epic 1 provided a fully stable and comprehensively tested UI (which Epic 3 builds upon) was incorrect. This gap poses a high risk for regressions and makes new UI development fragile without addressing it first.
    2.  **Pydantic Deprecation Warnings:** Impact: While low severity, these warnings indicate an outdated dependency usage that needs to be addressed for future compatibility and to prevent unexpected issues later.
-   **Impact on Epic 3:** The current plan for Epic 3 assumes a fully stable and comprehensively tested UI foundation from Epic 1. Epic 2 revealed significant gaps in automated UI/UX/Accessibility testing and unresolved technical debt (Pydantic warnings).
-   **Recommended Actions:** Review and update Epic 3 definition and affected stories (including explicit ACs for NFRs). Hold an Epic 3 planning review session after the prep sprint.

## Readiness Assessment for Epic 2

-   **Testing & Quality:** Production-ready (conditional on prep sprint). Action needed: Complete automated UI/UX/Accessibility tests in prep sprint.
-   **Deployment:** In Production (deviation from Epic 1 retrospective planning noted).
-   **Stakeholder Acceptance:** Not assessed (per user directive).
-   **Technical Health:** Stable (per user assessment).
-   **Unresolved Blockers:** None identified.

## Commitments and Next Steps

-   **Commitments Made:**
    -   Action Items: 9
    -   Preparation Tasks: 9
    -   Critical Path Items: 6 (including the Epic 3 planning review session)

-   **Next Steps:**
    1.  Execute dedicated prep sprint to address critical path items (estimated 7-8 days).
    2.  Review action items in next standup.
    3.  **IMPORTANT:** Hold Epic 3 planning review session to update Epic 3 definition and affected stories. Do NOT start Epic 3 until this review is complete.
