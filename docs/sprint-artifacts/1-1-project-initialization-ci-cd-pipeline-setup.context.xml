  <acceptanceCriteria>
1.  **Given** a new project is needed,
2.  **When** the initialization script is run,
3.  **Then** a standard folder structure (e.g., `src`, `docs`, `tests`) is created.
4.  **And** a `package.json` (or equivalent) with core dependencies (e.g., a web framework, test runner) is created.
5.  **And** a basic "Hello World" version of the app can be run locally.
6.  **And** a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) is configured to automatically run linters and basic tests on every push.
