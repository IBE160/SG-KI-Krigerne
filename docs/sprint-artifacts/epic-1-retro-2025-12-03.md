# Epic 1 Retrospective: Foundation & Core Chat Interface - 2025-12-03

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the retrospective for Epic 1, "Foundation & Core Chat Interface". The epic aimed to establish the essential technical foundation, a structured knowledge base, and a working, responsive chat UI. The team successfully completed all 4 stories, achieving 100% completion.

Key insights were gained regarding the importance of clear requirements, comprehensive automated testing for non-functional aspects, and proactive management of tooling and dependencies. Several critical items were identified that need to be addressed in a dedicated prep sprint before commencing Epic 2. A significant discovery was made that necessitates updating the plan for Epic 2.

## Team Participants

-   Bob (Scrum Master)
-   Alice (Product Owner)
-   Charlie (Senior Dev)
-   Dana (QA Engineer)
-   Elena (Junior Dev)
-   BIP (Project Lead)

## Successes and Strengths

-   **Clean and Intuitive Chat Interface (Story 1.3):** The core chat UI was praised for its design and usability.
-   **Effective Caching Strategy (Story 1.4):** A game-changer that significantly improved API call efficiency.
-   **Improved Dev Documentation (Story 1.4):** Contributed to smoother testing.
-   **Successful Establishment of Core Foundations:** The epic successfully delivered the base UI and knowledge base structure.

## Challenges and Growth Areas

-   **Early Communication and Requirements Finalization:** Gaps led to rework, particularly in backend stories (Story 1.2).
-   **Automated Testing for Non-Functional Requirements:** Significant difficulty implementing robust automated tests for UI responsiveness and accessibility (Stories 1.3, 1.4), leading to reliance on manual verification.
-   **Tooling and Dependency Compatibility:** Minor issues with `npx` during Tailwind/PostCSS setup and a `tsconfig.json` workaround for `shadcn/ui` (Story 1.1). Pydantic deprecation warnings highlighted dependency management concerns (Story 1.2).
-   **Partial NFR Implementation:** File permissions for `knowledge_base.json` (Story 1.2) were only partially implemented, deferring full enforcement to deployment.

## Key Insights and Learnings

1.  **Clear, Finalized Requirements:** The importance of upfront, unambiguous requirements to prevent rework and improve development efficiency.
2.  **Comprehensive Automated UI/UX/Accessibility Testing:** Critical for ensuring long-term quality, stability, and preventing regressions for user-facing features.
3.  **Proactive Management of Tooling, Dependencies, and NFRs:** Essential to avoid accumulating technical debt and to ensure future compatibility and robustness.

## Previous Retro Follow-Through Analysis

-   This was Epic 1, so there is no previous retrospective to reference. This is our first retro, setting the baseline for future improvements.

## Next Epic Preview and Dependencies

-   **Next Epic:** Epic 2: Core Question Answering
-   **Dependencies:** Epic 2 is highly dependent on the UI and knowledge base structure established in Epic 1.
-   **Key Preparation Needs Identified:**
    -   Robust automated UI tests for responsiveness and accessibility.
    -   Full implementation of knowledge base file permissions.
    -   Defined RAG testing strategy.
    -   RAG architecture and prompt engineering knowledge transfer.

## Action Items (from Epic 1 Review)

**Process Improvements:**

1.  **Improve early communication and requirements finalization for backend stories.**
    Owner: Alice (Product Owner)
    Deadline: Before Epic 2 planning
    Success criteria: Clearly documented and signed-off requirements for all backend tasks in Epic 2.
2.  **Establish a clear process for handling schema changes.**
    Owner: Alice (Product Owner) & Charlie (Senior Dev)
    Deadline: End of prep sprint
    Success criteria: Documented process for proposing, reviewing, and approving schema changes.

**Technical Debt:**

1.  **Implement robust automated UI tests for responsiveness and accessibility (Epic 1 UI components).**
    Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev)
    Deadline: End of prep sprint
    Estimated effort: 8 hours

    Owner: Amelia (Developer Agent)
    Deadline: End of prep sprint
    Estimated effort: 4 hours
    Success criteria: File permissions for `knowledge_base.json` are demonstrably secure and integrated into deployment process.
3.  **Address Pydantic deprecation warnings.**
    Owner: Amelia (Developer Agent)
    Deadline: End of prep sprint
    Estimated effort: 3 hours
    Success criteria: No Pydantic deprecation warnings in test runs.

**Knowledge Development:**

## Critical Path Items

**Blockers to Resolve Before Epic 2:**

1.  Implement robust automated UI tests (Epic 1 responsiveness & accessibility)
    Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev)
    Must complete by: End of prep sprint
2.  Fully implement knowledge base file permissions (AC7 from Story 1.2)

    Owner: (To be assigned)
    Must complete by: After prep sprint and before Epic 2 kickoff.
5.  **IMPORTANT:** Hold Epic 2 planning review session to update the epic and affected stories based on new learnings.
    Owner: Bob (Scrum Master) & Alice (Product Owner)
    Must complete by: After prep sprint and before Epic 2 kickoff.

## Significant Discoveries and Epic Update Recommendations

-   **Significant Changes Identified:**
    1.  **Incomplete Automated Testing for UI/UX/Accessibility:** Impact: Potential for regressions and a higher burden on manual testing in Epic 2. Future UI stories may inherit these testing gaps.
    2.  **Partial Implementation of Non-Functional Requirements (e.g., File Permissions):** Impact: Risk of security vulnerabilities or data integrity issues if not fully addressed before building critical features on top in Epic 2.
    3.  **Tooling and Dependency Management Issues (e.g., Pydantic warnings, tsconfig workarounds):** Impact: Potential for future compatibility problems, increased maintenance overhead, and unexpected delays in Epic 2.
-   **Impact on Epic 2:** The current plan for Epic 2 assumes a fully stable and comprehensively tested UI from Epic 1, and a completely robust and secure knowledge base infrastructure. Epic 1 revealed significant gaps in automated UI/UX/Accessibility testing and partial completion of critical non-functional requirements.
-   **Recommended Actions:** Review and update Epic 2 definition and affected stories. Consider updating architecture or technical specifications. Hold alignment session with Product Owner before starting Epic 2.

## Readiness Assessment for Epic 1

-   **Testing & Quality:** Not fully production-ready. Action needed: Complete automated UI/UX/Accessibility tests for Epic 1.
-   **Deployment:** Ready for deployment, holding off until issues are resolved. Scheduled for: After prep sprint completion.
-   **Stakeholder Acceptance:** Complete.
-   **Technical Health:** Concerns identified, but addressing planned prep items should resolve them.
-   **Unresolved Blockers:** None (beyond identified prep items).

## Commitments and Next Steps

-   **Commitments Made:**
    -   Action Items: 6
    -   Preparation Tasks: 1
    -   Critical Path Items: 5 (Automated UI tests, KB file permissions, RAG testing strategy setup, Epic 1 Deployment, Epic 2 Planning Review)
-   **Next Steps:**
    1.  Execute dedicated prep sprint to address critical path items.
    2.  Complete critical path items.
    3.  Review action items in next standup.
    4.  **IMPORTANT:** Hold Epic 2 planning review session to update Epic 2 definition and affected stories. Do NOT start Epic 2 until this review is complete.
